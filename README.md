# Breast Cancer Prediction uisng Various Machine Learning Models in R
A comparative analysis of various machine learning models for malignancy prediction of breast cancer cells
# Problem Definition
* Breast cancer a major health concern causing abnormality in cells
* Cancer specific to females with an exponential increase of death reports.
* An early diagnose is required for early clinical measures and increase in recovery rate
# Dataset Description
* Dataset available in UCI repository, for link [click here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
Dataset features include:
* region (average of distances from middle to spots on the boundary)
* surface (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
* boundary
* region 
* softness (local variation in radius lengths)
* density (boundary^2 / region - 1.0)
* incurvation (severity of concave portions of the contour)
* incurvation points (count of concave portions of the contour)
* symmetry 
* fractal portion ("coastline estimation" - 1)
